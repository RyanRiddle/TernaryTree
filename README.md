TernaryTree
===========

Lisp program that creates a ternary tree from a list

Use:
I run this program using the GNU Common Lisp command line tool.  I run gcl to get started.  
Then I load the program by doing (load "working.lisp").  
Execute the code by calling the main function with a list like so: (main '(1 8 3 7 9 0 2)).
The program will print out the ternary tree after each object is inserted.  

There is also a file called data.ternary.txt that contains a long list.  You can load this list and then 
call the main function on it.
